# tldraw for Slidev

Edit your [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev) diagrams directly in
[Slidev](https://sli.dev/)

![example](./example-assets/tldraw-in-slidev.png)

## Example with a new tldraw diagram

Add a new slide with the following content:

```md
---
# New tldraw diagram

<tldraw class="w-200 h-140" />
---
```

Make sure the diagram has a fixed width and height. Check the
[Slidev UnoCSS docs](https://sli.dev/custom/config-unocss) on which classes are
available.

Now, start the slideshow in development mode. Navigate to the slide, add new
shapes etc. The diagram content will be saved under the `public` folder and a
reference is created automatically in the existing slide.

## Example for existing tldraw diagrams

Create a `public` folder, store the tldraw diagram in it and reference it in the
slide:

```md
---
# Existing tldraw diagram

<tldraw class="w-200 h-140" doc="tldraw/example1.json" />
---
```

Note that the visible area is fixed to 800x800 for now.

## Cover entire slide

![example](./example-assets/cover-entire-slide.png)

If you want to cover the entire slide with a tldraw diagram, use the following
style:

```md
---
# Diagram covering entire slide

<tldraw class="inset-0 w-full h-full" />
---
```

## Features

![example](./example-assets/slidev-menu-grid-dark.png)

- tldraw diagrams can be edited directly in Slidev and are automatically saved.
- Uploading assets is fully supported, either via drag and drop or using the
  'upload media' menu item. Assets are stored in the `public/tldraw/assets`
  folder after uploading.
- Dark mode is automatically adjusted to the Slidev theme
- Exporting a Slidev presentation will include the tldraw diagrams
- Snap, tool lock and grid mode can be enabled via the menu or by keyboard
  shortcuts
- Inserting embeds is enabled

Other `tldraw` options, such as multi-page diagrams are disabled (for now). The
addon makes a tradeoff between features and simplicity.
